Yet if hope has flown away
Through my fingers to the deep,
That my days have been a dream;
O God! can I not save
Grains of the golden sand--
And I hold within my hand
Of a surf-tormented shore,
How few! yet how they creep
O God! can I not grasp
Is it therefore the less gone?


How few! yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep,
Grains of the golden sand--
Take this kiss upon the brow!
All that we see or seem
And, in parting from you now,
Is it therefore the less gone?
Is but a dream within a dream.
In a night, or in a day,

In a night, or in a day,
