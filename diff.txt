-And I hold within my hand
-How few! yet how they creep
-O God! can I not grasp
+But a dream within a dream?Is all that we see or seem
+Take this kiss upon the brow!
+One from the pitiless wave?
+And, in parting from you now,
+Them with a tighter clasp?
+O God! can I not save
+That my days have been a dream;
+One from the pitiless wave?
+Is it therefore the less gone?
+Of a surf-tormented shore,
+In a vision, or in none,
+But a dream within a dream?O God! can I not grasp
+Them with a tighter clasp?
+I stand amid the roar
+But a dream within a dream?Is all that we see or seem
+Of a surf-tormented shore,
+While I weep--while I weep!
