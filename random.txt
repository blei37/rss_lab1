But a dream within a dream?Is all that we see or seem
Take this kiss upon the brow!
One from the pitiless wave?
And, in parting from you now,
Them with a tighter clasp?
O God! can I not save
That my days have been a dream;
One from the pitiless wave?
Is it therefore the less gone?
Of a surf-tormented shore,
In a vision, or in none,
But a dream within a dream?O God! can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp?
I stand amid the roar
But a dream within a dream?Is all that we see or seem
Of a surf-tormented shore,
While I weep--while I weep!
